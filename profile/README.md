# BALL x PIT Mod Menu 

Steel hums. Gravity hesitates. A ball rolls toward the edge and, for a heartbeat, the world listens.
**BALL x PIT Mod Menu** is a gentle lever on that moment—a way to slow it, stretch it, or let it fall faster, exactly as you choose.

Built as a compact single-player companion for **BALL x PIT**, this mod menu invites experimentation without erasing challenge. It’s a tuning desk for motion and momentum, a place where practice becomes play and play becomes understanding.

## 🌒 Overview

The Mod Menu runs externally on Windows, offering real-time toggles and sliders. Nothing is permanent. Nothing is forced. You open a control, feel the change, then close it again—like adjusting the strings of an instrument before the performance.

Use it to:

* Practice tight sections without repetition fatigue
* Explore levels with altered physics
* Record cinematic or speedrun routes
* Learn *why* a jump fails, not just that it failed

* **Bounce Intensity**: soften landings or exaggerate arcs

### 🧭 Movement & Flow

* **Freeze Position** (study angles and slopes)
* **Time Scale** (slow motion for precision learning)
* **Checkpoint Warp** (practice a single segment)

### 🧪 Practice Utilities

## ❓ FAQ

**Is this meant for single-player only?**
Yes. The Mod Menu is designed for offline, personal experimentation.

**Will it ruin the challenge?**
Only if you let it. Many players use slow motion or gravity tweaks to *learn*, then restore defaults for clean runs.

**Can I revert instantly?**
Absolutely. Disable toggles or close the menu—physics returns to normal.

**Does it help speedrunning?**
Yes. It’s excellent for route testing, angle discovery, and muscle-memory practice.
